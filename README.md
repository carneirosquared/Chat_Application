This is my first public project!

I am currently enrolling in a programming bootcamp and very proud of my first real project.

How to use the app: 
- Start the Server by running the ServerLauncher;
- Start the Chat by running the Application;
- You can run the Application multiple times in a row to simulate different clients;

Open to criticism on my Java, code architecture and organization and documentation skills! 

Hope you enjoy this as much as i did working on it.
